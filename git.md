Git is very powerful.  Don't try to learn everything that it can do
all at once.  The 5 steps below should be enough in this class, for
projects where I create the template, and you work alone.

- fork on github - in browser, click `Fork` button at upper right (must be logged in)
- clone - `git clone git@github.com:yourName/repoName` - can copy this URI from browser
- commit changes - `git commit -a` - opens editor for a description of the changes
- push - `git push` - copy changes back to Github
- pull - `git pull` - If you've made changes from another computer since you were at this one.
im so confused but a good confused i think
